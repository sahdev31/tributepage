                    <ul id="ul-info">
                        <li><b>1914</b>- Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
                        <li><b>1933</b>- Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks<br> to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration"</li>
                        <li><b>1935</b>- Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian<br> Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed<br> them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li>
                        <li><b>1937</b>- Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li>
                        <li><b>1938</b>- Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget<br> cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under<br> Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li>
                        <li><b>1941</b>- Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is<br> rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT<br> to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.</li>
                        <li><b>1942</b>- Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
                        <li><b>1944</b>- Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his<br> pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program.<br> Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease<br> resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li>
                        <li><b>1945</b>- Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li>
                        <li><b>1953</b>- crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling<br> American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to<br> provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>
                        <li><b>1962</b>- Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian<br> subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly<br> expanding population</li>
                        <li><b>1970</b>- receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
                        <li><b>1983</b>- helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize<br> and sorghum yields</li>
                        <li><b>1984</b>- becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University </li>
                        <li><b>2005</b>- states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues<br> that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as <br>we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous<br> because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long<br> before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds." </li>
                        <li><b>2009</b>- dies at the age of 95.</li>
                    </ul>

                        "Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the far-reaching contribution<br>
                        that one man's towering intellect, persistence and scientific vision can make to<br> 
                        human peace and progress."
